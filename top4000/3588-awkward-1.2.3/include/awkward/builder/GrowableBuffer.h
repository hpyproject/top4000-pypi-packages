  ///
  /// @brief Contiguous, one-dimensional array that can grow indefinitely
  /// by calling #append.
  ///
  /// Configured by ArrayBuilderOptions, the buffer starts by reserving
  /// {@link ArrayBuilderOptions#initial ArrayBuilderOptions::initial} slots.
  /// When the number of slots used reaches the number reserved, a new
  /// buffer is allocated that is
  /// {@link ArrayBuilderOptions#resize ArrayBuilderOptions::resize} times
  /// larger. Thus, a logarithmic number of reallocations are needed as
  /// data grow.
  ///
  /// When {@link ArrayBuilder#snapshot ArrayBuilder::snapshot} is called,
  /// these buffers are shared with the new Content array. The GrowableBuffer
  /// can still grow because the Content array only sees the part of its
  /// reservation that existed at the time of the snapshot (new elements are
  /// beyond its {@link Content#length Content::length}).
  ///
  /// If a GrowableBuffer resizes itself by allocating a new array, it
  /// decreases the reference counter for the shared buffer, but the Content
  /// still owns it, and thus becomes the sole owner.
  ///
  /// The only disadvantage to this scheme is that the Content might forever
  /// have a reservation that is larger than it needs and it is unable to
  /// delete or take advantage of. However, many operations require buffers
  /// to be rewritten; under normal circumstances, it would soon be replaced
  /// by a more appropriately sized buffer.
